Introduction
This project is a classic Tetris game where you control falling blocks and try to clear lines. I learned how to build this game by following along with Servet Gulnaroglu's video tutorial. The tutorial was a great way for me to understand key concepts like game loops, handling user input, and managing game state in JavaScript.

While the core logic comes from the tutorial, I've made a few adjustments and improvements along the way, including [mention any features you added or changes you made]. This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I encourage others to try it out as well!

Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tetris-game.git
